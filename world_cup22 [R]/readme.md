### ***World cup of Qatar 2022 goals*** database in R language.

+ IDE: RStudio.

I constructed the database with data available in [flashscore.com](https://flashscore.com) behind the games on **WC Qatar 2022**.

The resulting file <kbd>world_cup_goals.csv</kbd> contains the goals on the 64 games of the tournament.


FILE(S)                              | Description
-----------------------------------  | ------------------------
<kbd>world_cup_goals</kbd>           | **R script** file (.R)

I will continue developing this project with graphs and R Markdown report
