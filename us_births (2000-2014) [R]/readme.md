# Data analysis in R language.

+ IDE: RStudio.

The Report was developed by data available into GitHub repository of [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births) behind the story *Some People Are Too Superstitious To Have A Baby On Friday The 13th*.

The file analyzed was <kbd>US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv</kbd>. It contains U.S. births data for the years 2000 to 2014, as provided by the US Social Security Administration.


Resulting FILES                      | Description
-----------------------------------  | ------------------------
<kbd>us_births_RMarckdown.Rmd</kbd>  | **R Marckdown** file (.Rmd)
<kbd>us_births_RMarckdown.html</kbd> | Output of R Marckdown in HTML
 <kbd>us_births_Quarto.qmd</kbd>     | **Quatro** file (.qmd)
<kbd>us_births_Quarto.html</kbd>     | Output of Quatro in HTML
